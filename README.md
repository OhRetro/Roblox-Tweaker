# Roblox Tweaker

## What is Roblox Tweaker?

It is a tool that allows you to tweak Roblox Textures, Like:

- Delete Textures.
- Restore Textures.
- List Textures.

## Requirements to Run

- [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) or higher.
- It should run on Windows 10 or higher. (I don't know if it going to work on Windows 7 or 8.)

I recommended using [Roblox FPS Unlocker](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker/releases) made by [axstin](https://github.com/axstin).
**Note: Roblox Tweaker is not a FPS booster.**
